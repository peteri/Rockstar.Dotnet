   Take Divisor from Number
End
Give back Number

Limit is 100
Counter is 0
Fizz is 3
Buzz is 5
Until Counter is Limit
	Build Counter up
	If Modulus taking Counter, Fizz is 0 and Modulus taking Counter, Buzz is 0
		Say "FizzBuzz!"
		And Continue
	If Modulus taking Counter and Fizz is 0
		Say "Fizz!"
		And Continue
	If Modulus taking Counter and Buzz is 0
		Say "Buzz!"
